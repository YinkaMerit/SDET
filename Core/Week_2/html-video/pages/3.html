        <p>Dragon Ball Super: Broly (Japanese: ドラゴンボール超スーパー ブロリー Hepburn: Doragon Bōru Sūpā: Burorī) is a 2018 Japanese anime science fantasy martial arts film, the twentieth movie in the Dragon Ball series, and the first to carry the Dragon Ball Super branding. It is directed by Tatsuya Nagamine and written by Akira Toriyama. It was the third Dragon Ball film personally supervised by creator Toriyama, following Battle of Gods in 2013 and Resurrection 'F' in 2015. The film will be the first traditionally animated film to feature the eponymous character since 1994's Dragon Ball Z: Bio-Broly, and the first to feature a reworked version of the character as part of the series' official continuity written by Toriyama</p>
        <p>This is the story of a new Saiyan. Earth is peaceful following the Tournament of Power. Realizing that the universes still hold many more strong people yet to see, Goku spends all his days training to reach even greater heights. Then one day, Goku and Vegeta are faced by a Saiyan called 'Broly' who they've never seen before. The Saiyans were supposed to have been almost completely wiped out in the destruction of Planet Vegeta, so what's this one doing on Earth? This encounter between the three Saiyans who have followed completely different destinies turns into a stupendous battle</p>
